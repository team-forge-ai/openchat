# Code Conventions

When writing or modifying code in this project, please adhere to the following conventions:

1.  **TypeScript Best Practices**: Follow standard, idiomatic TypeScript coding practices for structure, naming, and types, unless otherwise overridden.
2.  **Minimal Comments**: Avoid adding comments unless they explain complex logic or non-obvious decisions. Well-written, self-explanatory code is preferred. Do not add comments that merely restate what the code does.
3.  **Tests as Documentation**: Rely on comprehensive tests (which will be added later if not present) to document the behavior and usage of the code, rather than extensive comments within the code itself.
4.  **File naming conventions**: Use kebab-case when naming directories, TypeScript, and other files.
5.  **Type checking**: after major modifications run `pnpm typecheck` and fix any errors.
6.  **UX/UI** We are using Tailwind CSS, React, shadcn/ui components and Lucide React icons. Generate responsive designs. Provide default props for React Components. Check to see if a shadcn component exists under `src/components/ui` before installing it.
7.  **Models/db/tables** When pulling in a database type, Kysely.
